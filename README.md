Problem/Opportunity:
In the Industries, Unexpected equipment failures in an industrial setting can result in expensive downtime, lost production, and costly repairs. As they don't handle possible breakdowns in real time, traditional maintenance techniques like planned maintenance can be ineffective. By employing machine learning to anticipate equipment breakdowns before they happen, predictive maintenance offers a data-driven solution that minimizes unscheduled downtime and maximizes operational efficiency.

Goal:
The main goal of this research is to develop a machine learning model that, using sensor data, including temperature, vibration, pressure, and other machine operational parameters, may be used to anticipate machinery breakdowns in real time. To lower maintenance costs and downtime, the system will suggest maintenance tasks before faults happen.
Success Criteria:
•	In order to accurately forecast machinery breakdowns, the predictive model must attain a minimum of 85% accuracy.
•	By giving timely maintenance recommendations, the system should successfully lower maintenance costs and downtime.
•	Updating the machine health in real time should be displayed on the dashboard, giving maintenance personnel an easy-to-use interface.
•	All project milestones should be reached, and the project should be finished in the allotted time.
Future Work
•	Incorporating more diverse features, such as vibration data, maintenance history, and environmental factors, to improve prediction accuracy.
•	Using advanced deep learning techniques, including recurrent neural networks and transformers, for time-series analysis.
•	Exploring domain adaptation techniques to generalize findings across different settings and industries.
•	Developing a user-friendly dashboard for real-time monitoring and prediction of machine failures.
